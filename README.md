# Model Card Builder

Model Card Builder converts Hugging Face model metadata into typed model cards and publishes a dual-source conservation AI catalog. The dashboard indexes all NMFS-OSI models and a pinned snapshot of the Microsoft SPARROW model zoo.

## What It Does

- Fetches model metadata and README content from Hugging Face
- Normalizes data into a typed Model Card Data contract
- Optionally enriches missing narrative sections with GitHub Models using prompt files
- Generates Model_Card.html with named template and theme architecture
- Indexes all seven NMFS-OSI models and the pinned SPARROW TOML catalog
- Generates source-aware totals, filters, cards, and an NMFS-OSI/SPARROW toggle
- Archives NMFS-OSI detail cards and generates gallery registry data
- Publishes static site output through GitHub Pages automation

### Stage Notes

- Trigger policy: manual workflow_dispatch always runs; issue-triggered flow runs only when the generate-model-card label is applied to an issue containing a Hugging Face URL.
- AI step: summarization and recovery are designed to be fault-tolerant in workflow execution so generation can continue if enrichment fails.
- Output artifacts: Model_Card.html, model_data.json, and build logs are uploaded as workflow artifacts; gallery content is regenerated and deployed.

## Hugging Face Integration

The builder integrates with Hugging Face at multiple layers:

- API metadata fetch from huggingface.co/api/models/{repo_id}
- README fetch from huggingface.co/{repo_id}/raw/main/README.md
- URL-to-repo parsing for inputs like https://huggingface.co/org/model
- Frontmatter and section extraction for overview, intended use, deployment, limitations, and training details
- Metric extraction using pipeline-aware regex patterns (for example mAP, precision, recall, F1, accuracy)
- Asset extraction from markdown images for representative visuals
- Completeness assessment to identify missing facets before optional recovery

This logic is implemented primarily in python/model_card_data.py and feeds downstream rendering and gallery publication steps.

## Automation and Publishing

Workflow file: .github/workflows/model-card-builder.yml

- Fetches and normalizes model data
- Runs optional AI summarization and targeted recovery using prompt contracts
- Builds HTML output
- Archives card to gallery/cards/
- Generates gallery/cards.json from catalogs/nmfs-osi.toml
- Normalizes the pinned catalogs/sparrow.catalog.toml snapshot
- Regenerates gallery/catalog-data.json and gallery/index.html
- Prepares site/ and deploys to GitHub Pages

## Architecture Notes

- Template: named arrangement of sections and blocks in the Card Document
- Theme: named visual treatment applied by the renderer
- Catalog source: `catalogs/nmfs-osi.toml` is curated locally; SPARROW remains upstream-owned and is stored as a hash-verified snapshot
- Generated files: `gallery/cards.json`, `gallery/catalog-data.json`, and `gallery/index.html` must be rebuilt with `python python/build_catalog.py`

Model Card Builder uses these internal extension points while presenting a single automated pipeline at the product level.
