## In plain language

* Finds **≈9 of 10** fish in a frame  
* **Rarely** confuses coral/rocks for fish  
* Slide the confidence slider → right to cut *false positives*  
  (you'll skip a few shy fish)

## Key numbers

| Metric    | Value | What it means |
|-----------|------:|---------------|
| Precision | **0.885** | Share of detections that are real fish |
| Recall    | **0.861** | Share of all fish that are found        |
| mAP@0.5   | **0.937** | Combined quality score                  |
