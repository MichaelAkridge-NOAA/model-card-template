### In plain language

* Finds **~9 of 10** fish in a typical frame  
* **Rarely** mistakes coral or rocks for fish  
* Slide the **confidence slider → right** to reduce *false positives*  
  (but you might miss a few shy fish)

### Key numbers

| Metric      | Value | What it means – short & sweet |
|-------------|------:|--------------------------------|
| Precision   | **0.885** | Share of detections that are real fish |
| Recall      | **0.861** | Share of all fish that are found       |
| mAP@0.5     | **0.937** | Combined quality score                 |

> **Tune the confidence threshold**

| 0.20 | 0.50 *(default)* | 0.80 |
|------|------------------|------|
| Catch *everything* | Balanced | Only the sure hits |

> “*All models are wrong, some are useful.*”

Trained on expert-labelled images – both humans **and** models can be wrong.  
Use the detector as a helpful **preview**, not the final answer.
